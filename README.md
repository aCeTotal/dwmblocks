# dwmblocks-async
My perfect build of the [dwmblocks-async](https://github.com/liubianshi/dwmblocks-async) status bar for my perfect build of dwm, [perfectwm](https://github.com/SpyHoodle/perfectwm).

## scripts
I store my scripts in `.local/bin`, which is added to my `$PATH`.<br>
You can find my scripts in my [scripts repository](https://github.com/SpyHoodle/scripts).

## installation
**Note:** DWM needs the [status2d](https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/status2d/) patch for rendering colours.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/SpyHoodle/dwmblocks
```
Change directory to dwmblocks
